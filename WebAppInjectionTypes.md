### Analyzing Dangerous Web Application Injection Types:

|      Injection     | 
| ------------------ |
|        SQL         | 
|        XSS         |
|        Code        | 
|        Command     |
|XML External Entity |
|         LDAP       |

## Defending
As developers, we must be informed on ways to write secure code within our time constraints. Keeping in mind that user input validation and sanitization are preventative measures. 
The longer a malicious actor has access to systems, the more damage they may cause. 

- As an AppSec engineer, we must work with our developers to understand, listen, and assist as a team rather than as an 'them'. Communication is an everyday challenge and we should focus on develop ourselves to actively listen.
