## DAST
Dynamic Applcation Security Testing 
- Process of analyzing a web app through client side to locate vulns via simulated attacks
- DAST scanner to id security vulns

|         Pros               |              Cons           |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Better at app and context   |        Somewhat noisy       |
| Independent of App         | Can't ID the exact location |
|Immediate finds vulns       | Security experience needed  | 
|No access to source code    |        Time consuming       |
|Continuous search for vulns |          False positives    |
|No access to architecture   |   Later stages of SDLC      |
