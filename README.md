# Transitioning ToC yberSecurity Application Security
(January 1, 2022) - Journey from Software Engineer to Cyber Security Engineer


# whoami
I started my training in Software Engineering as an immersive student at General Assembly in Denver, CO. I found myself seeking more education and needing to understand the Python scripts that were interpreted and wanting to know what and how to interpret. 

Then I joined and completed my second immersive, this time in Java 8. The instructors at Skill Distillery in Greenwood Village, CO taught me the foundations that I was missing. I dove in deeper into a new passion and wanted to know how to break, create, and repair software code in Java and Python. Now I felt ready to join the ranks of software engineers, but the road to getting your first role was paved with so many technical challenges that I began to get good at interviewing. 

However, I wanted to land my first tech gig so I continued to interview and network. That's the secret sauce, keep networking and programming. Stay open to doors that close, new opportunities.

# find your passion
In January of 2021, I ran into a person I looked up to in the technical field and that person asked me "What's your passion?". That question seemed interesting and little did I know that was going to guide me to not only become great at my passion, but feel challenged to make my passion part of my worklife. That person pointed me towards Kali Linux, then it was like my theme song was on full blast in the background. I was led to find bugs to programs that were written by the very companies I was interviewing at. Awakening confidence in me that I didn't know lay dormant.  

# unpaved roads
I was finding bugs that seemed common and would be considered low risk, but my write ups would improve. Submitting bugs and leading me down a path of using software programming security tools. These tools are not taught in my traditional univeristy nor the capture the flag events I was attending, instead these tools were introduced on Youtube by security researchers all over the world. I was hooked. 

# 2021 
My passion led me training on topics that I was weak at and wanted to keep improving on, tools like:
- [ ] CompTIA Network+ knowledge not certified yet
- [x] COMPTIA Security+ ce certification
- [x] IBM Cybersecurity Fundamentals
- [x] ITIL 4
- [ ] Bluetooth and Radio Frequency
- [ ] IoT

Going through SD26 documentation to improve my knowledge on Java 8
- [x] More Python
- [x] JavaScript
- [x] JQuery
- [x] RegEx
- [x] SQL
- [x] Typescript
- [x] Bash
- [x] Shell

Capture the Flag events

Lightning talks 

Cyber Security Frameworks
- [ ] ISO 
- [ ] CSF
- [ ] CMMC
- [ ] NIST


Student volunteer with WiCyS (Women in Cyber Security) org, with goal to be a mentor for 2022 cohorts.

This 2022 year, I welcome the new year by learning GO and C# to improve my personal projects. 
I have set a should that will help me get E-Council Certified Application Security Engineer certificate and becoming better informed at GRC standards. 

To be continued..
